# Clap App
The Clap App simulates clapping using the mobile device's proximity sensor (TYPE_PROXIMITY). It detects the proximity between the phone and a hand and displays visual feedback based on the proximity values.

Features
- Proximity Detection: Displays the proximity sensor's value in real-time.
	- 0: Clap detected.
	- 10: Max sensing distance.
- Dynamic Emoji:
	- Displays a single hand emoji when the sensor detects no clap.
	- Displays a clapping emoji when the sensor detects a clap.
- Visual Feedback: The app updates the UI with live proximity values and changes the image based on the detection.
- UI Elements:
	- App title: "Clap App"
	- Dynamic text: "Ready to Clap" or "Clapping"
	- Proximity sensor value displayed.


How to Use
- Clap Simulation: Hold your phone and bring your hand close to the proximity sensor (usually near the earpiece) to simulate clapping.
- Visual Feedback: The app will display real-time proximity values and change the emoji to clapping when a clap is detected (proximity value of 0).
